This project is a reconstruction of a previous work.  The main purpose of this
venture is to demonstrate understanding of OOP in the context of building a
program, as well as familarizing myself with using git as a DVCS.

There are three main classes and a single interface that  I will be 
working on:

A Book interface,
A Patron class,
A LibraryBook class,
And the Library class containing the main method.

Within the Library class the lowOption variable should typically stay unchanged, but the high option
should always correspond to the exit option for the user.

 * This program allows the user to add and remove patrons.
 * Add and remove library books.
 * See lists containing all patrons or all Library books in the system.
 * Books, if checked out, display the due date.
 * Patrons display first and last name and books checked out, if any.
 * The ability to search for a patron or library book by key phrase / word.
 * Check out a library book.
 * Display a list of all currently checked out Library books.

This is a re-creation of a earlier school project, as stated before.  I thought it would be good practice
in getting acquainted with GitHub.

Once the bulk of the project is complete, I'll be practicing making branches and merging with new
experimental add ons / features.
This Library system is about as scalable as a lemonade stand, but hey, gotta start somewhere.
