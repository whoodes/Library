This project is a reconstruction of a previous work.  The main purpose of this
venture is to demonstrate understanding of OOP in the context of building a
program, as well as familarizing myself with using git as a DVCS.

There are three main classes and a single interface that  I will be 
working on:

A Book interface,
A Patron class,
A LibraryBook class,
And the Library class containing the main method.

Within the Library class the lowOption variable should typically stay unchanged, but the high option
should always correspond to the exit option for the user.
